# Command-Prompt-snake-game
This is a simple game coded with python to run snake on command prompt. NOTE: THIS WILL ONLY WORK ON WINDOWS SINCE IT USES THE msvcrt MODULE.

Using the python console will result in really slow output, it is recommended to build the game first to a .exe file.
When asked for characters please only input one single character, inputting more than one will result in breaking the game

Run redo.py
